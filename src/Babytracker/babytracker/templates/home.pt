        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Babytracker is a mobile and web application that can help you
          keep track of what your baby or babies are doing each day. Through a
          simple and intuitive user interface, you can record events such as when
          and how much they eat and sleep, and when you have changed their
          nappies.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Babytracker was created by father of twins and software developer
          <a href="http://martinaspeli.net">Martin Aspeli</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are free to use the application, but please note that, like babies,
          it comes with no warranty or guarantees. We will attempt to keep it running
          and to take care of your data, but as long as the application
          remains in <em>beta</em>, it may go down without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Babytracker works best in modern browsers like
          <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or
          <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a>.
          There are no plans to test it on Microsoft Internet Explorer.
