      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Babytracker is a mobile and web application that can help you
        keep track of what your baby or babies are doing each day. Through a
        simple and intuitive user interface, you can record events such as when
        and how much they eat and sleep, and when you have changed their
        nappies.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Babytracker was created by father of twins and software developer
        <a href="http://martinaspeli.net">Martin Aspeli</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are free to use the application, but please note that, like babies,
        it comes with no warranty or guarantees. We will attempt to keep it running
        and to take care of your data, but as long as the application
        remains in <em>beta</em>, it may go down without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Babytracker works best in modern browsers like
        <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or
        <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a>.
        There are no plans to test it on Microsoft Internet Explorer.
